		<em>A rapid prototype app UI for sleepy students.</em>
		<p>
			I would often fall asleep while listening to news podcasts (sorry CNN) and found myself retaining information I had never heard                      conciously. I then began to do this with class lectures (not sleep during lectures...listen to lectures while I sleep) and it worked                like a charm. So why not have a beautiful material design for other students to learn while sleeping. Sleep + Student = A+ Now that's               an equation I fully support. This is currently a work in progress but I hope to put it out soon.
