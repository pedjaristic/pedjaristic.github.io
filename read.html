							<h1>WHY REDONDO?</h1>
							<p>The original Redondo created by ELMO was inspired by “a nostalgic love for reading” (ELMO 2016). With the REDONDO READ, we enhanced this original purpose. We have created a bookshelf that enhances a reading environment, and even allows the user to take a piece of the Redondo with them when they leave their house. With the Redondo READ, users can spark that nostalgic love for reading wherever they are, and have an enhanced experience at home.</p>

									<h3>TRADITIONALLY MODERN</h3>
									<p>In the recent past there has been an increase in e-reader devices over more traditional reading options (books, magazines, newspapers, etc.) (Hancock 2016, 25-30). Americans have found it easy to switch to e-readers, however, this is not the case for Hong Kong. Many adults in Hong Kong prefer to read magazines and newspapers, which are harder to access on e-readers (Ng 2015).</p>

									<h3>ENHANCING</h3>
									<p>The Redondo READ includes a white noise machine, music speakers, ambient lighting, a charging pad and an Arduino with NFC capabilities. The white noise, music and lighting components are customizable by individual use, user preferences or default settings, providing the reader with ultimate control over their environment.</p>

									<h3>PORTABLE</h3>
                                    <p>The Redondo READ gathers a user’s reading preferences on the Redondo READ e-book. Then, it can load content onto the e-book that is tailored to them when the user places the e-book back in its designated compartment on the Redondo READ shelf. This allows them to take it with them wherever they go.</p>

									<span class="icon major fa-sliders"></span>
									<h3>UNINTRUSIVE</h3>
									<p>There are many different components to the Redondo READ, and they have been placed in specific spots to provide ease of access and/or be unobtrusive. First, the white noise machine and sound speaker are placed in the bottom of the Redondo READ to minimize the amount of space they take up. Second, the lighting strip is located at the bottom of the Redondo READ, shining upwards to create an ambient lighting environment. In the final design, the Arduino chip should be embedded into the wood of the Redondo READ,</p>
