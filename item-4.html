        <h2>The Vision</h2>
		<p>
           PV's mission is to <b>build the next generation of student leaders</b> to tackle the world's challanges, create innovative solutions,              and make a positive impact using technology. Product Vision is partnered with the creators of <b>Hack The North</b> so you can expect BIG things.
		</p>
        
        <h2>How do we do it?</h2>
        <p>
			From educational tech talks, to innovation treks at the biggest compamies; PV's main goal is to inspire <b>big thinking!</b>
            The Hacker House project, for example, is a product incubator run in Seattle where Waterloo students can venture to create the next               big product.

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        
		<p>
            From designing the branding and experience for various projects and events to ideating and innovating new ones. Product Vision is                     structured similarily to a startup. I personally had a hand in each one of the clubs initiatives from branding to logistics. <b>Currently I am working on re-branding PV and implementing the website I have designed below.</b> </p>

        <h2>PRODCON</h2>
        
        <p>I personally owned the design and development of Waterloo's first product-minded conference along with the logistics and sponsorship teams. PRODCON is a conference where students learn about product design and management from industry veterens. They then get to flex what they learned by participating in a product challenge where they develop a product solution to a company problem.</p>

        <p>Applications for PRODCON 2017 will be open soon.</p>
        
        <h2>Design Workshops</h2>
        
        <p>I lead a series of design and development workshops on the University of Waterloo campus as a passion project within PV. Both design and Programming are something I am extremely passionate about and I wanted to share that passion and inspire others to pursue it. Just because you aren't in a design or CS program, doesn't mean you can't <b>create something amazing!</b></p>
