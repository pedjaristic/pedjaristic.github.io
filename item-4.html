        <h2>The Vision</h2>
		<p>
           PV's mission is to <b>build the next generation of student leaders</b> to tackle the world's challanges, create innovative solutions,              and make a positive impact using technology.
		</p>
        
        <h2>How do we do it?</h2>
        <p>
			From educational tech talks, to innovation treks at the biggest compamies; PV's main goal is to inspire <b>big thinking!</b>
            The Hacker House project, for example, is a product incubator run in Seattle where Waterloo students can venture to create the next               big product.

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        
		<p>
            From designing the logos and graphics for various projects and events to ideating and innovating new ones. Product Vision is                     structured similarily to a startup. I personally had a hand in each one of the clubs initiatives from branding to logistics. </p>
        
        <h2>OnePM</h2>
        
        <p>I am personally owning the branding, design, and ideation of Waterloo's first product-minded hackathon along with the logistics and sponsorship teams. OnePM is a hackathon where students will be able to create a product idea and prototype that they can then take beyond the hackathon to further with support from PVC. OnePM focuses on <b>Product Management</b> and multi-disciplinary teamwork.</p>
        
        <p>Pictured below are my iterations on the OnePM logo/brand and the in-development application website.</p>
        
        <img class="head-image" src="Assets/PVC-Portfolio/one-pm.jpg">
        
        <p>OnePM is partnered with the creators of <b>Hack The North</b> and is slated for Winter 2016. Applications will be open soon.</p>
        
        <h2>Design Workshops</h2>
        <p>I lead a series of design and development workshops on campus as a passion project within PV. Both design and Programming are something I am extremely passionate about and I wanted to share that passion and inspire others to pursue it. Just because you aren't in a design or CS program, doesn't mean you can't <b>create something amazing!</b></p>
