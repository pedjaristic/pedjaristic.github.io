		<h2>Thank you!</h2>
		<em>Thanks for visiting and looking through my portfolio.</em>
		<p>
            I am constantly working on new projects and will continue to add them here. I tried my best to make this portfolio easy to read and access for you <b>recruiters</b> out there. I know you have to see hundreds of them, so thank you for taking the time to read this.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are some simple games that I have coded as thanks for making it this far. Sometimes you have to stop and smell the roses.
